It is said that the Zotz once came from Xibalba, a great cavernous realm underneath the forests of Mictlan. The Zotz live in caverns and are rarely seen on the surface world  Coacotepec's Senior Diabolists of Madness are masters of blood magic. Coacotepec's Senior Diabolists of Madness are short-sighted officials whose commands are executed by their escorts. They are extraordinarily brave wizards and their morale in battle is unbreakable."

#descr "Caelians are of lighter stock than humans and their wings make them slow in combat. But flight has its own benefits and makes Caelian armies quick and unpredictable.  Caelians of the Raptor clan are stronger and more warlike than other Caelians. As their lineage descends from the wicked Daevas rather than the Yazatas, they have no particular tolerance for cold. Murgjagan's Library-Keepers are craven leaders whose plans are enacted by their minions. They are trained in facilitating magical research and will improve the efficiency of all researchers in their province. They are protected from toxins."

#descr "Caelians are of lighter stock than humans and their wings make them slow in combat. But flight has its own benefits and makes Caelian armies quick and unpredictable.  Caelians of the Mairya clan are the strongest and most warlike of all Caelians, in keeping with their Daevic ancestory. They have no particular tolerance for cold. The Supreme Devoted Pyromancers are experts of fire magic. The Supreme Devoted Pyromancers are respected for their skills and are sometimes seen as religious authorities. The Supreme Devoted Pyromancers of Spivi are unexceptional leaders whose plans are obeyed by their minions."

They breed and grow quickly while sharing the Abysian resistance to heat; however, their flesh is far cooler than their hellish ancestors.

The Neophytes of Occult Wildfires are known for their studies and are allowed a place in Djesu's religious hierarchy. Djesu's Neophytes of Occult Wildfires are inexperienced leaders whose decrees are enacted by their escorts."
