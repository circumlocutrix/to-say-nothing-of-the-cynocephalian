It is said that the Zotz once came from Xibalba, a great cavernous realm underneath the forests of Mictlan. The Zotz live in caverns and are rarely seen on the surface world  Coacotepec's Senior Diabolists of Madness are masters of blood magic. Coacotepec's Senior Diabolists of Madness are short-sighted officials whose commands are executed by their escorts. They are extraordinarily brave wizards and their morale in battle is unbreakable."

#descr "Caelians are of lighter stock than humans and their wings make them slow in combat. But flight has its own benefits and makes Caelian armies quick and unpredictable.  Caelians of the Raptor clan are stronger and more warlike than other Caelians. As their lineage descends from the wicked Daevas rather than the Yazatas, they have no particular tolerance for cold. Murgjagan's Library-Keepers are craven leaders whose plans are enacted by their minions. They are trained in facilitating magical research and will improve the efficiency of all researchers in their province. They are protected from toxins."

Gaeni's Novice Exarchs are short-sighted officers whose commands are obeyed by their attendants. They are trained in fighting heresy and they can quickly stamp out hostile religions."

#descr "The Abysians are a race of hellish humanoids with magma bodies. They radiate a furnace-like heat and are impervious to all forms of fire. The Kings of Occult Wildfires of Djesu are experts of fire and death magic. Djesu's Kings of Occult Wildfires are venerated for their power and Djesu looks to them for spiritual authority. Djesu's Kings of Occult Wildfires are unexceptional leaders whose orders are carried out by their guardians. They are empowered with raiments of magic ice; moreover, they will explode as a burst of elemental energy upon death, spawning a fire elemental."
